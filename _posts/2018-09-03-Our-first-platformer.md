### There's one control

You control Frank, a simple happy frog who has one goal in life, to jump to the next platform. 

When you tap, Frank jumps.
When you hold and tap, Frank jumps further.

Make Frank get as far as possible.

### Difficulty and progression

At first the game was supposed to progress by zooming out, and the jumps become furhter and further, so the hold mechanism would be more sensitive. However, as things progressed, I felt like that was too complex, so we simplified it down much further to make the platforms become narrower over time.

### Is it fun?

You tell me.
