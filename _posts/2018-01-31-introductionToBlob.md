This is my first time writing a blog post, or any type of media, so bear with me.  I wanted to describe our first and new project

Juuno is developing a puzzle game called **Blob**. We've been working on it for about four months since last September and are preparing for gold release by the first half of 2018. It's an abstract game where you slice rectangles into different sizes to fulfill goals for the level.

Before we get into the details, Blob has got three main features that we're really excited about

	* It's easy to start playing
	* Can be played by anyone (all ages)
	* It's relaxing 

During our design and development, and redesign and redevelopment, we constantly kept these in mind. Blob should be embracable by _everyone_, and it should be so easy to play that instructions are kept to a minimum. The level progression should be the natural tutorial for new players, and players who are not so familiar with puzzle games.

However, we're also aiming for something relaxing, so that players can immerse themselves in Blob's world and enjoy where they are.

Every step of our journey, we keep reassessing what we're doing, and making sure that it aligns with these core values.

## "Where Did You Get The Idea?"

Uncannily, the idea for [Blob](https://juunoco.github.io/blob) was conceived and designed from a series of scribbles through two chapters of a Defensive Driving Course textbook...and a soft tissue. 

You never know what will come up, so I always keep some tissue handy.

## So, what is this game that we're crazy about, actually about?

To put it simply, we're trying to visually represent the experience of having to share one thing equally among many. 

Let's say that you have `1` piece of cake.

You will need to distribute that '1' piece of cake equally among `5` different people.

It's easy</center>

		1. Get the cake
		2. Cut it into five equal pieces
		3. Give each person one piece. 

<center>
		_(Wow, that was easy)_
</center>

Okay, but what if the cake is one of those weird cakes that can't be easily split into five? _(For some reason...It's a Triangular Cake)_

Or maybe each person wants a different sized piece...

	* Jenny's on a diet and wants a small piece
	* Jason's hungry and wants a larger piece
	* Kim doesn't want any cake at all

It becomes more difficult when you take peoples' preferences into account.

## Okay, So Blob is about cake?

Blob is...kind of about cake.

But it's more about slicing one big blob into many small ones. With each slice you need to figure out if it will match the size of the goals around it, and not distract from the other goals.

Each level has different requirements, and by fulfilling these requirements, you get to progress onto the next level. But let me warn you, `this game is challenging`, not __too__ challenging, but it's for people who enjoy solving problems and challenging themselves. 

That's all I'm allowed to tell you about the rules of Blob, of course there's a lot more happening and it's an interesting experience, but you'll have to try it out yourself to know for sure :)
